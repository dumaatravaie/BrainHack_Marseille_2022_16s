# BrainHack_Marseille_2022_16s
16S rRNA gene sequencing is commonly used for identification, classification and quantitation of microbes within complex biological mixtures such as environmental samples and gut samples. Many studies [1][2] are trying to establish the link between the intestinal microbiota with different neurodevelopment, neurogical disorders etc. In these studies the BioInformatic analysis of the data coming from gut samples plays a very important role. So, in our brainhack project we will work on the publicly available data from one of these article[1]. So, this project is aimed for those who are interested in the BioInformatic analysis of Gut Microbiota and are also interested in the different pipelines and analysis tools like QIIME2[4] , cutadapt[5] , Kraken2[6] etc.

In this project, we propose:

    To go through this [1] article to understand their method of analyzing the gut microbiota
    To download their 16s sequencing data from NCBI (submitted by the authors)
    To extract and filter the data


For advaced users, We also propose:

    To write( Python ) few tools for filtering the sequencing data
    To try to create an Anaconda environment or a Singularity image with the 16s analysis pipeline QIIME2[4]
    To try to implement some of the methods of analysis with QIIME2 (as described in the article)
    To understand the importance of reproducibility of the results
